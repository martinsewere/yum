Yum is a Web app that allows users to input into fields all ingredients they have at home. After hitting the search
button, recipes from multiple websites query the input data and outputs recipes that use that exact result. 
If you are confounded by what the heck you want for dinner, Yum is here!

With the slow decline of casual dining restaurants, millenials are realizing that cooking and eating at home is not only
beneficial to their health, but their wallets as well. With this web app, we introduce a way to ease the process for new 
cooks and veterans alike, by suggesting recipes based on what is already in their kitchen cabinet or a curious thought. 

The basic premise of this web app is that the user will input ingredients into a field, hit "search" and the web app will
retrieve recipes based on keywords the user inputs. The user is then able to select which recipe is appealing to them,
see the required ingredients, and get a Youtube video guide on how to prepare them.
